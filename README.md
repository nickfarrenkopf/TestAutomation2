This is for a work project I tried to introduce at my previous software job.

This program was meant to use Machine Learning to automate manual testing of the web platform.

It would watch a user take action (screen, keyboard, & mouse inputs) & learn to mimic those actions when presented with a given screen.

Program created autoencoder networks to read screen & predict likely action type & location.

Program created small  networks for each test case, so testing could be lightweight, trained quickly, & easily specialized.

Program was able to automate several small tests that I had normally done manually.

NOTE: none of the datasets were stored on GitHub
